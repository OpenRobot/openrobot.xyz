            <br>

            <p class="openrobot-definition" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;">
                OpenRobot was found at 2021, when the Covid pandemic happend.

                Before OpenRobot existed, LyricMaster was the organisation name, reference to the now OpenRobot Owner, proguy914629. <br><br>

                OpenRobot used to be called as LyricMaster-Bot. LyricMaster-Bot is the legacy of OpenRobot. 
                Since then, LyricMaster-Bot has been growing, with other partners.
                The developers and owners of LyricMaster-Bot was thinking to rename LyricMaster-Bot organization because:

                - LyricMaster-Bot organization was growing quickly with other bots than LyricMaster
                - There was also other bots e.g M.S. Counter and Fifi

                <br>

                The developers thought that this was the time to change the name of LyricMaster-Bot organization.
                We (<a href="https://github.com/proguy914629bot">proguy914629bot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whyfai">whyfai</a>) searched for names available.

                <br>
                <br>

                We brainstormed and thought about these ideas: <br>

                - MemeStudios<br>
                - OpenBots<br>
                - OpenBot<br>
                - OpenProject<br>
                - OpenRobot<br>
                - OpenRobots<br>
                - OpenProjects<br>
                - OpenDeveloper<br>
                - OpenDevelopers<br>

                <br>

                We thought those options through one by one, and agreed that OpenRobot was the best. We didn't pick the others because of either 2 reasons: <br><br>

                - The naming of it is bad<br>
                - It doesn't make sense with the context of the whole organization<br>
                - The names are already taken in GitHub<br>

                <br>
                So here we are, changing the whole organization system and name.
